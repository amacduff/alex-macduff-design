            <h2>Project Description</h2>
            <p>This is a design test I completed as part of an interview process. I was asked to choose a website I considered to have “bad UX” and redesign it.</p>
            <p>I chose the PA DMV site, because I think most people agree that DMV sites, and government sites in general, can be difficult to use.</p>

            <h2>Problem</h2>
            <p>I started by spending a little time using the site. I googled the most common DMV tasks and tried to accomplish a handful of them on my own. Here are a few observations I made:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Too many links on the homepage</li>
                <li>Hero section disappears on mobile</li>
                <li>Overcomplicated navigation system</li>
                <li>Too much text</li>
                <li>Scary alert messaging</li>
            </ul>
            <p>I decided to reimagine 3 aspects of the site: the homepage, an informational page, and a form.</p>

            <h2>Research</h2>
            <p>First, I made a quick survey and put it on Facebook. I didn’t get a ton of responses, but I got enough to learn a few things about why people use a DMV website, as well as some common tasks and pain points. Basically, people either want to accomplish a task (like renewing their vehicle registration or driver’s license), or get information before going to a DMV location. Most people seem to use the website to avoid going in person. So convenience, saving time, and ease of use are big motivators. The biggest pain points were that the site was difficult to use or difficult to understand.</p>
            <p>From there I made 3 basic personas. I used generators to get name and basic info, and matched some of the motivations, goals, and frustrations I pulled from my survey to each one of these.</p>

                <dd>She's just out of college, so she's starting to read for fun again. She has an entry level marketing job. She wants to see what her friends are reading and what's popular in her favorite genres, and she has a goal of reading 30 books this year. She likes to read young adult fiction and in her free time she rides a unicycle.</dd>

                <dd>She has two kids and homeschools. She doesn't have much time to read, so she likes to use the site for recommendations and reviews (mostly from friends) and making lists. She likes historical fiction and has a Civil War crush.</dd>

                <dd>Single and middle aged, he works at a non-profit organization. He travels a lot for work, so he reads on the plane and in airports. He goes through books fairly quickly. He uses the site to keep track of what he's read, and to get recommendations for what he should read next. He enjoys reading nonfiction and biographies, and likes to play golf.</dd>
            </dl>
            <p>Armed with a better understanding of who I was designing for and what they were trying to get done on the site, I was able to start working toward a solution.</p>

    <section class="planning">
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Planning</h2>
            <p>I went back to the site and made a list of all the links on the homepage, taking note of duplicates. I decided the page could benefit from some better information architecture. I looked up several other DMV sites and lifted some basic categories that were more descriptive than the current ones. Then, based on the top links section, I made a short list of possible quick links for the most common tasks.</p>
            <p>For the homepage, I wanted to focus on minimizing the amount of options on the page and providing better categories to make it easier for users to find what they’re looking for. There would necessarily be less potential to get where you’re going in one click, but according to Steve Krug’s book “Don’t Make Me Think”, it’s ok to require multiple clicks to get to what you’re looking for, as long as you don’t have to think about each click. That was my goal. I made some sketches of a simpler homepage, one version with a header section dedicated to news and alerts, and one with a header dedicated to quick links.</p>
            <p>For informational pages, the site currently has tons of pages, and each one has very little content. It’s easy to feel lost in terms of where you are on the site. So I imagined each category as a single, condensed page, with clearly marked sections and navigation so you can see where you are and easily find what you’re looking for.</p>
            <p>For forms, I imagined a multi-step process that shows you exactly where you are and how much further you have to completion. This is something I learned when designing for conversion rate optimization. Most forms convert better as multi-step forms. I designed a couple different versions of this: a tabbed version and an accordion version.</p>

    <section class="design">
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Design</h2>
            <p>I made some wireframes to lay out the content, using a mobile-first approach. For styling, instead of reinventing the wheel, I used the U.S. Web Design Standards, which are a set of guidelines for design and code, developed specifically for use in government sites. It’s really clean and modular, and for the purposes of this project, it enabled me to focus less on visual design.</p>
            <p>For the homepage, I mocked up the version with a header section focusing on news and alerts. In an ideal world, I would love to test this version against the other version I sketched, to see which works better. But in the interest of time, I only mocked up one version. It focuses on a news item or alert that would be pertinent to anyone visiting the site. Then immediately below there are some quick links to some of the most common tasks people like Elizabeth might come to the site for, and then if you’re looking for something else, you can easily search right here at the top of the page. When search is clicked, it also offers a list of popular search queries.</p>
            <p>For the information page, I focused on making the content more condensed and easy to see where you are on the site. Instead of spreading information across multiple pages, each with only a paragraph or two of information, I combined everything into one page with a sort of table of contents. I wanted to make it easy for someone like Evelyn to find the information she’s looking for.</p>
            <p>For the form, again I wanted to condense things to one page. I think someone like Lester would appreciate knowing exactly where he is in the process and how many steps to completion. I used an accordion style form, so when Lester is done filling out one section, the next section slides up to replace it. I removed a lot of the explanation text on the page, as pretty much all of it can be replaced by inline feedback.</p>
            <p>All of these things would need to be tested and iterated on, but that’s what I came up with for a rough first pass.</p>
