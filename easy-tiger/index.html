            <h2>Project Description</h2>
            <p>Another of my UI Design projects at The Iron Yard was to redesign a local restaurant's current website. I was allowed to pick any restaurant I wanted to work on. I chose Easy Tiger, a popular bake shop and beer garden located on 6th street in Austin. This was a really fun project to work on, because it not only gave me a chance to exercise some of the research methods I had just learned in class, but also an excuse to spend more time at a local eatery I love.</p>

            <h2>The Problem</h2>
            <p>The problem I see with Easy Tiger's current website is mainly that there's not much there. The site is very dark - small white text on a black background - and doesn't really relay a sense of what the place is like. The homepage is a giant image map with no selectable text, except for the address and phone number at the very bottom of the page, in tiny text that almost blends into the background. And the menu is a PDF.</p>
            <p>None of this is really that bad. It's minimal, which is fine, and was probably made to be easy to update. If there are changes to the menu, all they have to do is upload a new PDF, not mess around with editing files in a content management system. Additionally, it could be that the site was made to look homemade. It kind of gives you the sense that this is a small place whose focus is their craft, not their marketing. Still, I thought the site could benefit from a redesign, to make it easier to find and use, and more representative of the atmosphere of the location, which I think is one of its best attributes.</p>

            <h2>Research</h2>
            <p>One of the first things I did was go to the restaurant. I had been there before as a customer, but had never really stopped to take in the atmosphere of the place. I observed and had some brief conversations with customers and employees, and tried to get a sense of their clientele as well as the restaurant's values.</p>
            <p>Then, using some of the methods I learned in class, I continued my research by conducting competitive and SWOT analysis. I also made a word list in an attempt to push past some of the more obvious lines of thought.</p>

            <h2>The Solution</h2>
            <p>I redesigned the site with the goal of making something light and friendly, to reflect the relaxed atmosphere of the place.</p>

            <h2>Challenges</h2>
            <p>The biggest challenge I faced with this project was one of ethics. I'm generally not a fan of altering another designer's work.</p>
            <p>This is one challenge I welcomed. I realized that wherever I go, the likelihood that I will be working alone, with complete creative control, is pretty low. And realistically, I don't want to be in that kind of situation. Working with another designer, I came to appreciate collaboration and how we can spur one another on to do better work.</p>
