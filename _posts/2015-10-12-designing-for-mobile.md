# Project
This past week I worked on something a bit different than we've been doing up to this point: designing a native mobile application. This is something I've been interested in learning more about; something I asked about in my original telephone interviews. I knew designing for a native app would differ from designing for a mobile browser, but I didn't know how different it would be. So I was pretty excited to dive in and start learning.

Without getting into the nitty gritty, the project consisted of working with a client (a design alumnus) to create a working prototype of a native mobile application. There were basic requirements for research, planning, design, prototyping, and iteration.

# App
Our client wanted an app that could connect restaurants who want to donate extra food with volunteers who could pick it up and deliver it to organizations that could distribute it to people in need. She called it "Extras." It's a fantastic idea for an app, and both my partner and I were excited about it from the start.

# Approach
From the start, it was pretty clear that there would be two user groups for our app: restaurants and volunteers. My partner and I created a user flow that started with a question: "Are you a Restaurant or Volunteer?" and from there helped them to get signed up, logged in, and helping other people as quickly and easily as possible. We ended up dividing the work, each designer taking one path: Jay took the volunteers, and I took the restaurants. Periodically we would compare our work and make necessary changes to ensure consistency. It worked out pretty well, I think.

# Challenges
As in any design project, there were considerations to be made, problems to solve.
