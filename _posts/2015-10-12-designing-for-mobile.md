# Project
This past week I worked on something a bit different than we've been doing up to this point: designing a native mobile application. This is something I've been interested in learning more about; something I asked about in my original telephone interviews. I knew designing for a native app would differ from designing for a mobile browser, but I didn't know how different it would be. Needless to say, I was pretty excited to dive in and start learning.

Without getting into the nitty gritty, the project consisted of working with a client (a design alumnus) to create a working prototype of a native mobile application.
