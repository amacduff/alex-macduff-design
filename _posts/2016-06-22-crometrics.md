## Work Lyfe
A few months after graduating from The Iron Yard, I started doing contract design work at CROmetrics. Now that I've been there for about three months, I thought I'd share some thoughts about my experience so far. TLDR: It's been a good experience.

## Hiring Process
To be honest, the gig kind of fell into my lap. I was invited by Laura Stude to try my hand at some contract work, on a trial basis. It's been about three months now, and they haven't asked me to leave yet, so I must be doing *something* right. Actually, the hiring process is one of the many things I think CROmetrics is doing right.

Without getting into details, all candidates are brought on for a trial period that is effectively a paid interview. During that time they will be assigned projects and tasks like any other member of the team. It's a great way to see how people work and if there's a good fit, culturally. In an industry where the hiring system seems completely broken, CROmetrics stands out as a company who treats candidates as team members before they're hired.

I realize a system like this isn't feasible at every company, and maybe someday, due to growth or other factors, CROmetrics will need to change their hiring practices. But I trust that they will always find a solution that continues to benefit both parties and does not reduce potential candidates to mere numbers.

## Work
The CRO in CROmetrics stands for *conversion rate optimization*. So basically the one goal of the company is to improve companies' websites so they can grow. This is done through data-driven experimentation and rapid iteration. CROmetrics' mission is one I can really get behind. Coming from a background in freelance web design, I was accustomed to making sites and deploying them, but never having the time or capacity to test or iterate on my initial designs. It's been really great having a hand in making sites better and easier to use. I've definitely added some usability knowledge to my design tool belt. So yeah, I thoroughly enjoy the work I'm doing.

Most of what I do is visual design, no coding involved. But one of the things I like about CROmetrics is their growth mindset. I'm sure there will be coding options for me.

## Culture
Like many other teams these days, CROmetrics is a distributed company. As with everything, there are benefits and challenges to this sort of working culture.

### A Few Benefits
- Freedom to work from anywhere
- No cost to rent office space
- No need to relocate new hires

### A Few Challenges
- Difficulty working across time zones
- Communication requires more work
- Employees shoulder the cost of dedicated work space

CROmetrics does a great job of keeping its team members connected via tools like Slack, Trello, and regular video chats. Additionally, there are a handful of team members in Austin who are starting a coworking space. I'm looking forward to the possibility of sharing an office space with colleagues.

## Things I Love About Working At CROmetrics
- The mission of the company is something I can really get behind.
- I get to work on a variety of projects.
- I get to work with some insanely talented individuals.
- I can work from anywhere.
- Company culture includes use of the word *y'all*.

## In Summary
It's only been three months, but my experience at CROmetrics has been positive; it's a great place to learn and grow. Because they are distributed, they can put together a team of the best people available, without being limited by location. As a result, I work with a super talented group of individuals. I consider myself lucky to work with such a team and company.
