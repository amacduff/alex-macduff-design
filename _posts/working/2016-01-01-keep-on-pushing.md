## Background
When I started school at The Iron Yard, one of the first things we did as a class was to create GitHub accounts so we could upload our assignments. In fact, all of the classes at TIY use GitHub. I remember fairly early on, hearing the Ruby instructor tell his students to commit often, stressing that GitHub activity was something that potential employers view as a plus. That peaked my interest, and I started making a concerted effort to commit and push my work.
