## Background
In October 2015 I was studying UI Design at The Iron Yard when Sam Kapila passed along something she had just found called Daily UI, a project to "become a better designer in 100 days." At first it seemed rather daunting, especially with final projects coming up. But Sam suggested we "Geico it up" and try to complete each day's exercise in 15 minutes or less. That sounded less intimidating, so I decided to give it a go.

## In Summary
