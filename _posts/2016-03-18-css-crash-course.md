## Background
A couple months back I volunteered as a <abbr title="Teacher's Assistant">TA</abbr> at a crash course on <abbr title="Hyper Text Markup Language">HTML</abbr>/<abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> my <abbr title="User Interface">UI</abbr> Design instructor, Abby Larner, was teaching at The Iron Yard. It was a pretty good experience, and I really enjoyed seeing some people learn about code for the first time. So I reached out and asked Abby if she could use some help again at an upcoming event. As it turned out, she had all the help she needed for the event I inquired about, but she mentioned she was looking for someone to teach an upcoming crash course. After a minute or two of daydreaming about my very own crash course, I volunteered. It didn't take long, though, before reality started to settle in, and I found myself asking, "What am I going to teach?" After a little thought and a little coaching, I landed on a deep dive into <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>. It felt right. I know <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>. I'm comfortable with <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>. The only question was, could I talk about it for three hours?

## Planning
The first thing I did was have a little freakout. Could I actually do this? Could I actually stand in front of a bunch of strangers and talk about <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> with any degree of authority? Sure, I had answered some questions from fellow students during my time at The Iron Yard, but that seemed very different than starting at the beginning and going through a deep dive into the subject. Once I was done with that, I thought to myself, "How did I learn <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>?" I learned from books and the web, so I went back and reviewed. I flipped through *CSS3 For Web Designers*. I clicked through some Code School PDFs. I watched some Tuts+ videos. I started to get a feel for what I thought I could teach. Then I sat down and made an outline. It was pretty ambitious and a little unrealistic. But it was a start.

### Section One
- Intro/Linking Stylesheets
- Selectors
- Cascade Order
- Floating Left & Right
- Clearing Floats
- Inheritance & Specificity
- Margins & Padding

### Section Two
- Text & Font Properties
- Anchors & Links
- Images
- Backgrounds
- Borders
- Lists
- Width & Height

### Section Three
- DRY
- Display Types
- Centering
- Pseudo Classes & Elements
- Transition
- Hover
- Transform
- Animation

## Building
Next, I had another little freakout. Could I actually design and build a sample site that people could look at and learn from? Fortunately, I had some other sample sites to look at and learn from, so that didn't last too long. I decided to make something with a deep sea theme, to compliment the topic of the crash course: A Deep Dive Into <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>. It was a good exercise, writing code I knew other people would not only be looking at, but also trying to learn from. It forced me to think differently. I always try to keep my code clean, so that wasn't a big deal. But I found myself asking new questions, like "Should I alphabetize my properties, or should I write them in the order in which I'll be teaching them?" or "Should I use percentages/ems, or should I use pixels to keep it simple?" It was interesting and challenging to think about not just making something well, but to make something that a beginner could pick apart and learn from. It was a good exercise for me, and I like to think it changed the way I think about and write code.

## Practice
Once everything was built, I had one final freakout. Now I actually had to present and teach this thing! I was chatting with a peer from my <abbr title="User Interface">UI</abbr> Design class, and he said to me, "I'm kind of surprised you're doing this. It goes against everything I know about you." Funny thing is, he was right. I'm an introvert at heart. I get nervous wehen talking to anyone new, and public speaking is even more intimidating to me. But I knew this would be good for me on multiple levels, so I figured it was worth it.

It wasn't easy, but I slowly started gathering my thoughts and piecing together my presentation. I started to feel a little more confident that I wasn't going to completely tank. I tested the beginning part of my demo out on my wife, and she fell asleep; that wasn't very encouraging. I told myself it would be different for people who were actually there by choice and interested in the topic.

## The Event
The day of the event I was feeling pretty nervous. I spent some time reviewing my notes and doing some last minute prepping. The event itself was pretty low key, which I appreciated. There were maybe twenty attendees. Abby acted as my <abbr title="Teacher's Assistant">TA</abbr>, which was a real relief. I started with a simple "Hello World" exercise and introduced some basic <abbr title="Hyper Text Markup Language">HTML</abbr>, and then got into the <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>. Everything went pretty smoothly and everyone was able to keep up the entire time. There were only a handful of questions, most of which I was able to answer. Abby fielded the tougher ones. As I write this, it seems odd to not have more to say about the actual crash course. But in a way, it's very representative of the whole experience; compared to the preparation that preceded it, the evening was fairly short.

## Feedback
After the event, Abby had a few pieces of constructive criticism, which I gladly accepted. Her three main points, simplified, were as follows:

- Too apologetic / nervous
- Too many unexplained terms / concepts
- Not enough enthusiasm

She told me all these things were understandable, and assured me that for my first time teaching, I did a great job. I'm looking forward to putting this feedback to good use, not just in future teaching and speaking engagements, but also in interviews.

## In Summary
Looking back, I'm a little surprised I volunteered to do this so readily. But whatever made me do it, I'm glad I did. I've said many times before that I want to share the things I've learned with others, and I think this was a pretty good start. I've already volunteered to give a short talk about <abbr title="Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets">Sass</abbr>. After doing a three hour live demo on <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>, talking for thirty minutes about <abbr title="Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets">Sass</abbr> doesn't seem so intimidating. I look forward to all the things I have yet to learn and share.
