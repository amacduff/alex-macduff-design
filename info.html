        <p>Hi, my name is Alex. I live in beautiful Austin, Texas. I love coffee and breakfast tacos. I also have a passion for making clean, easy to use websites and applications.</p>

        <p>A recent UI Design grad of The Iron Yard, I have experience in multiple stages of the design process, including production, prepress, illustration, branding, and web design. I have a working knowledge of HTML, CSS, and Sass. I also know just enough Javascript to get myself into trouble. As a designer, I have a keen eye for detail; as a graduate of a coding boot camp, I also know how to be efficient with my time and meet deadlines.</p>

        <p>I am a lover of typography, responsive design, simplicity, and usability. I am a perpetual student, constantly reading and learning. Two books that really helped shape the way I think: <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Inmates-Are-Running-Asylum-Products/dp/0672326140/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1447547407&sr=1-1&keywords=the+inmates+are+running+the+asylum" target="_blank">The Inmates Are Running The Asylum</a></em> by Alan Cooper, and <em><a href="http://abookapart.com/products/responsive-web-design" target="_blank">Responsive Web Design</a></em> by Ethan Marcotte. I enjoy being part of a team, and working with colleagues and clients to find creative and efficient solutions for problems.</p>
