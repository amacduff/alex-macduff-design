        <p>Hi, my name is Alex. I live in beautiful Austin, Texas. I love coffee and breakfast tacos. I also have a passion for making clean, easy to use websites and applications.</p>
        <p>If you'd like to work with me on a project, or if you share a love of Mexican cuisine, <a href="mailto:hello@alexmacduff.com?subject=Hello!">shoot me an email</a>. I like making new friends, and I'm always looking for a good excuse to get tacos. You can also follow me on <a href="http://dribbble.com/amacduff" target="_blank">Dribbble</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/amacduff" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, or <a href="http://instagram.com/alexmacduff" target="_blank">Instagram</a>.</p>

        <p>I am currently a UI design student at The Iron Yard in Austin, Texas. I have experience in multiple stages of the design process, including layout, illustration, typography, web design, prepress and production. I use Adobe CS on a daily basis in my freelance work. I'm a Mac person, but can be comfortable using any operating system. I have a working knowledge of HTML, CSS, and Sass. I also know just enough Javascript to get myself into trouble.</p>

        <p>As a designer, I have a keen eye for detail. Because I have extensive production experience, though, I know what it takes to be efficient and to meet deadlines. I am a lover of typography, responsive design, simplicity, and usability. I am a perpetual student, constantly learning new and better practices and keeping up with the constant evolution of technology, web, and design. I enjoy being part of a team, and working with colleagues and clients to find creative and efficient solutions for their design needs.</p>
