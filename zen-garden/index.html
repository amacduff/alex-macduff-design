            <h2>Project Description</h2>
            <p>In the world of web design, the CSS Zen Garden is like a rite of passage. It's a challenge to style a single page of HTML using <em>only</em> CSS. As a UI Design project, each student was assigned a different art movement to use as a theme for their design. I was assigned op art, whose foundation is optical illusions.</p>
            <p>An assignment designed to stretch our coding skills, we were allowed to skip mockups if we wished, and design in browser. This project was especially fun for me, because I've seen CSS Zen Gardens designed by people I look up to, and this gave me an excuse to finally give it a go.</p>

            <h2>The Problem</h2>
            <p>The problem I see with Easy Tiger's current website is mainly that there's not much there. The site is very dark - small white text on a black background - and doesn't really relay a sense of what the place is like. The homepage is a giant image map with no selectable text, except for the address and phone number at the very bottom of the page, in tiny text that almost blends into the background. And the menu is a PDF.</p>
            <p>None of this is really that bad. It's minimal, which is fine, and was probably made to be easy to update. If there are changes to the menu, all they have to do is upload a new PDF, not mess around with editing files in a content management system. Additionally, it could be that the site was made to look homemade. It kind of gives you the sense that this is a small place whose focus is their craft, not their marketing. Still, I thought the site could benefit from a redesign, to make it easier to find and use, and more representative of the atmosphere of the location, which I think is one of its best attributes.</p>

            <h2>Challenges</h2>
            <p>The biggest challenge I faced with this project was one of ethics. I'm generally not a fan of unsolicited redesigns of other people's work. It's easy to say you could design something better than someone else when you're not working with a client or having to sell your design or defend your decisions. Additionally, unsolicited redesigns feel like a sort of one-upmanship and reflect poorly on the design community as a whole.</p>
            <p>I was able to overcome this thinking by reminding myself of a few things:
            <ul>
                <li>This was a project for school, so in a way it wasn't completely unsolicited.</li>
                <li>I was working under the supervision of an instructor, who for the purposes of the assignment, was the client.</li>
                <li>I was only going to be posting this on GitHub and my portfolio, and expressly stating that it was schoolwork.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Similar to copying other people's work, I think redesigns are acceptable in the context of learning. It's when you start posting them on the web, announcing you've done a better job than the original creator, that you get yourself into trouble.</p>
